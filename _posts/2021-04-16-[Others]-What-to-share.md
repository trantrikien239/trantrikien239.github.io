It's been a long time since the last time I share something. Lately, I have been feeling that my life is moving too fast. If I could keep a blog about what I do and what I think, I can retain the knowledges collected along the way. Furthermore, doing the additional research for the blog would force me to deepdive into the topic, and thus, enrich and crystalize the insights.

So what could I write about? Here are some of my initial thoughts:

1. Machine learning practice in real-life industry set up:
    - Pipeline
    - Kaggle competition as a flight simulation
    - Understand business needs and ML problem formulation
    - Top 5 challenges in applying ML/AI
    - How to form an effective Data Science team
2. Personal finance - telling while doing about my financial moves
3. Mathematic aspect of Computing and Machine Learning

Hmm, interesting topics to choose from :))
