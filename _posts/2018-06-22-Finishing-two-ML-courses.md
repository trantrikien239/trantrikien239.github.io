It‚Äôs been more than 2 months since I started this blog, but it has been extremely in-active due to my laziness when it comes to writing üôÅ To be honest, I have been actively learning data science, especially statistical learning ‚Äì the theory for machine learning, but to write something about it requires another level of commitment. So I guess I will use this blog as a place to exhibit the certifications frome 2 courses on statistical learning that I have finished:

- An Introduction to Statistical Learning ‚Äì an online course taught by Pr. Trevor Hastie and Pr. Robert Tibshirani of Stanford University.

- Statistical Learning ‚Äì an offline course organised by Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics.

Plus, I am going to work for Boston Consulting Group as a Business Analyst. It‚Äôs more of a consulting work rather than something machine learning related. So, this blog might not be about data science anymore, or at least for a couple of months. Since I can swap my personal domain (kientran.win) with the current domain (learning-data.science), the content of this blog can be about everything now :))

Good bye a chapter in life where I tried to become a data scientist. I am still very much interested in the field though, it‚Äôs just I want to spend a year or two to look at the industrial 4.0 with a more business-oriented point of view.
